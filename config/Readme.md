### Producer Configuration

If you want to compile Protongraph in Kafka Producer mode, i.e. `make kafka` from the root directory, you'll want to read this section.

In particular, this folder should contain the secrets and configuration for connection to your Kafka VM.

In particular, within this path, you'll want to place

1. a kafka.config, containing the configuration for your Kafka VM.

This file should take the form
```
# kafka.config
BROKER=your.broker.com:port # the url of your broker; this could be localhost:9092 or otherwise. Note, port defaults to 9092.
TOPICS=hello # a list of topics to produce to
```

2. if you are connecting to a secured Kafka VM, you will also need a folder called secrets, with the following files within it

```
ca_cert-your.broker.com.pem
ca-cert-your.broker.com
ca-key-your.broker.com
client_cert_key-your.broker.com.pem
client_cert-your.broker.com.pem
client-cert-file-your.broker.com
kafka.client.keystore.jks
kafka.server.keystore.jks
```

Here, broker.com is the url of your secured broker.

These secrets can be generated by running

`generate.pem.sh your.broker.com yourpreferredsupersecretpassword`.

Note that you'll also need to move the relevant secrets to your VM as well in order for this to work, for instructions on how to do this, see [this guide from Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/KafkaIntegrationGuide/UsingSSLwithKafka.htm?tocpath=Integrating%20with%20Apache%20Kafka%7CUsing%20TLS%2FSSL%20Encryption%20with%20Kafka%7C_____0).
