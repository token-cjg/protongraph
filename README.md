# ProtonGraph

**Work in progress, please read the Current Status section**

A node based tool for procedural content creation.
Which means, you have a collection of nodes that you connect together to
create a complex result. You can see it as a form of visual scripting, but
for 3D models generation.

## Current Status

ProtonGraph is currently going through **a lot of refactoring** and a rebrand. As a result, **it's not usable
right now**, but the next major update is due soon and will break backward compatiblity. Therefore I suggest
you to wait until it's released. 
Release announcement will be made here and on the social media listed below.

### Rebrand
ProtonGraph used to be called ConceptGraph, but I noticed Microsoft already have a product called like
this, they also own the domain name and possibly the trademark too. So we rebranded the tool as ProtonGraph
after running a community poll. This way we get a unique name (as in, not in used by anybody else) and
a valid domain name and you won't mix it up with conceptual graphs which are completely different things.


## Roadmap

ProtonGraph is a standalone software but it's a lot more convienient to drive the content generation from
you engine of choice. So the immediate priority is to get a sync plugin running for the Godot engine as 
a proof of concept. 

Why? Because this requires internal changes that may or may not break compatibility so it has to be done
as soon as possible. Once the software works as expected, we need to write massive amounts of documentation
on how to actually use the software, tutorials and example files.

## Build from source
If you want to build the project from source yourself, you will need a custom version of the engine.
Follow the instructions on this repository: https://github.com/proton-graph/environment.

## Social medias

Despite being a very new project, the Protongraph community is growing. Head over to the Discord server if you want to ask for help
and hear about every little update or work in progress. Head over to Youtube or LBRY to access video tutorials.
